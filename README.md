# Security Game

This is the repository for the Security Game project made for the fictional client called Doge CyberSafe for a Software Engineering university project.

Couldn't fork from the classroom repo but all is good.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing

Add the database file.

```
Place the database.sqlite file into the SecurityGame/bin/Debug folder.
```

### Logging In

There are two accounts set up for you to login to the game with. One is an ordinary player account, while the other is an administrator. These accounts should be removed when deployed.

**Administrator account:**
```
Username: Admin
Password: password
```

**Player account:**
```
Username: Player
Password: password
```

Only the administrator account has access to the admin panel on the main menu.
